<!-- Below are examples of Arrays and Loops.
These are important within daily coding so get familiar with them and 
how they operate. -->

<?php

$names = array('Taylor', 'Margie', 'Thess', 'Pyper');

$count = 1;
// Loop for counter up to 100 within a list tag.
while ($count < 101) {
    echo "<li>$count</li>";
    $count++;
}
?>




<!-- Below is a while loop, using the same array as above 
we can call them into a loop and fill out sentences using 
the information passed through the while loop.  Pretty neat 
stuff. -->
<?php
// an array of names 
$names = array('Jon', 'Jane', 'Paul', 'Tommy');

$count = 0;
// Loop for calling names from array above to fill out the 
// sentence.  This is a "while loop" Very important and used in WP.
while ($count < count($names)) {
    echo "<li>Hi, I'm $names[$count] Welcome to our home. </li>";
    $count++;
}


?>
<!-- This is being called be the original PHP code above.  -->
<p>Hi, my name is <?php echo $names[3]; ?>.</p>
